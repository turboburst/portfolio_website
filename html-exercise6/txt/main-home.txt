        <p>Ordered the strawberry shortcake for a birthday and all I can say is WOW! Honestly one of the best cakes I’ve ever had. It was incredibly fresh and the taste and texture was fantastic. Will 100% be going back and would strongly recommend to anyone thinking of buying a cake!</p>

        <p>We were walking by on the way back from brunch and the smell drew me in. I wasn't even hungry mind you but it all just smelt too good to not get food!  We ordered the mini donuts and a few cookies and oh my godddd I wish we ordered more!</p>

        <p>I wanted to send you a quick note to give an immense thank you to the team! My sister got engaged a few weeks ago. Not only did she and her new fiancé love the funfetti cake, she cried when she opened the box at the message. Thank you again and I will forever be a supporter of you!</p>
