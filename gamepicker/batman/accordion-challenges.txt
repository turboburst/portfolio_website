Combat Training
<p>As the name suggests, these are just some basic training episodes that introduce you to the fighting system of Arkham Origins. There are 12 of them in total.</p>
<p>All of these challenges are very easy. To unlock all of them you need to buy upgrades for Batman in story mode. </p>

Combat Challenges
<p>There are 12 different Combat Challenge Maps. You can play them in different challenge modes and add modifiers, but the requirements will always be the same. You just need to reach a certain point threshold by the end of the fourth round. You get points for every attack and counter you perform.</p>
<p>The most important thing is your multiplier. There's a very easy trick to avoid being hit. Land one standard strike, then jump over an enemy and repeat. None of the enemies will be able to hit you if you are jumping quick enough. It takes a little longer than countering and fighting the normal way, but it's much safer and easier to do. If you have already unlocked the Shock Gloves you should activate them to get a x2 multiplier with each hit.</p>
<p>Always kill the last 2-3 enemies with a ground pound finisher at the end of each round. If you manage to keep your multiplier going, you will get massive points for performing a ground pound. You can use the ultra cape stun against the last few enemies to knock them out for a while. Gives you more than enough time to perform a ground pound on an enemy.</p>
<p>The best combo finisher to farm points is the batswarm. It will hit and confuse all surrounding enemies without causing damage. Doing this in large groups of enemies, while having a x50 multiplier or higher, will give you insane points. </p>

Predator Challenges
<p>There are 12 different Predator Challenge Maps. You can play them in different challenge modes and add modifiers, but the requirements will always be the same. Challenges automatically become available when playing through the story. To unlock the six extreme versions you need to beat campaign challenges. Certain abilities and gadgets are needed for some of the medals, so it's highly recommended to complete the story first and buy all of Batman's upgrades. </p>
