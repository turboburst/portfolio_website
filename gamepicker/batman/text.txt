It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.

  <h2>Gadgets</h2>
  <p>In <strong>Batman: Arkham Origins</strong>, the Caped Crusader supplements his intellect and training with an arsenal of non-lethal weapons and utility-belt gadgets. </p>
  <p>Though many sequences in Batman require fistacuffs, some puzzles can only be solved through gadgets. Additionally, Batmanâ€™s distance weapons can soften up a group of enemies and equalize an otherwise dangerous melee encounter.</p>
