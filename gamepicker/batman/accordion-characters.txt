<strong>Batman</strong>, the game's namesake, serves as your hero

<p>Does he need any introduction? Batman, aka Bruce Wayne, is the protagonist of the Batman: Arkham Series and will return to kick some more supervillain backside in Arkham Origins.</p>
<p>Since the game is confirmed to take place in a currently unspecified time frame (all we know is it's before the events of Arkham Asylum and Batman is much younger), the title will focus on Batman's first encounter with a band of supervillains who are out for his blood.</p>
<p>For the first time in the Arkham series Batman will not be voiced by longtime Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy, instead The caped crusader will be voiced by Roger Craig Smith. </p>

<strong>Robin</strong>, boy wonder

<p>Robin, the Boy Wonder (Dick Grayson) appears as a playable character in the online multiplayer modes. As there will be no multiplayer on Wii U, there is no confirmation that Robin will be playable on the console.</p>

<strong>Gordon</strong>, an early adversary and possible ally
<p><img src="batman/characters/gordon.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Jim Gordon is a Gotham City Police Captain in Batman: Arkham Origins.</p>
<p>Gordon begins the game as an adversary of Batman, though he hopes to capture the Caped Crusader rather than to kill him. </p>

<strong>The Joker</strong>, Batman's nemesis
<p><img src="batman/characters/the-joker.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Along with Bane, Joker is the leader of one of the two playable gangs in the Multiplayer game modes. Players can let the Joker in the match via point streaks, and even play as the character, as was shown in footage of the Multiplayer Beta.</p>
<p>As seen in the E3 demo, it doesn't seem that he intends to kill Batman, as he is just threatening to bomb buildings throughout the night. </p>
<p>In Arkham Origins, the Joker will be voiced by Troy Baker.</p>

<strong>The Penguin</strong>, eccentric criminal mastermind
<p><img src="batman/characters/the-penguin.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Oswald Cobblepot, better known as The Penguin, is shown to be a returning villain in Arkham Origins.</p>
<p>His appearance is very similar to how he looked in Arkham City, though the game does take place before the bar brawl that took his left eye.</p>
<p>Nolan North has also been confirmed to reprise his role as The Penguin from Arkham City.</p>
